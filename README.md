# Suronex – Homepage Revamp

This project is a frontend revamp of the **Suronex homepage**, built as part of the  
**Crescentia One – Web Development Internship Task**.

The objective was to design and develop a **modern, enterprise-grade SaaS landing page**
that clearly communicates Suronex’s value while maintaining a premium look and smooth user experience.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Suronex is an **AI-powered security and compliance platform** designed for enterprises.

This homepage focuses on:
- Clear value proposition
- Strong visual hierarchy
- Smooth animations and interactions
- A modern dark SaaS aesthetic

Only the **homepage** is implemented, as required.  
No login, pricing, or internal pages are included.

## 🎨 Design Approach

- Dark, modern UI inspired by enterprise SaaS products
- Purple gradients used for brand emphasis
- Glassmorphism applied selectively on cards
- Clean spacing and layout rhythm
- Animations used to enhance clarity without affecting performance

Design inspiration was taken from platforms like **Sunzero**, **Wiz**, and **Vanta**.
